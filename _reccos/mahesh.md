Vinay's UX work is dominated by how users think and marrying that with UX research that's out there. His ability to think differently and map user behaviour to the product's UX was great. We would butt heads for hours on designing the perfect UX and yet come out thinking it was a joyful experience where we learnt from each other. I enjoyed that balance Vinay brought to the team. He would have a strong point of view but be open to new ideas to be able to find a new approach that invariably ended up being the user's natural journey. Wouldn't think twice working with Vinay once again if the opportunity presents itself.
