Vinay works at a lightening pace. Never takes a hacky approach to solve a problem. He is solely responsible for bringing in user centric design for most of our product offerings. He set up the UX standard for the team to follow. 

He asks the right set of questions and never jumps into solutions unless he is convinced about the problem statement. 

Highly committed and motivated. He is the goto person for gamification consulting in the organisation

It was fantastic working with you! All the best for your future endeavours !
