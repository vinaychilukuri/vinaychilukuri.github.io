Vinay brought a structure to how design was done at KNOLSKAPE. He put various processes in place in order to smoothly facilitate PM-designer-developer collaboration. 

He is a great team lead who looked after how to make our game better. He suggested us books, got subscriptions to video courses, new tools to try so that we were constantly improving ourselves. 

When there was no budget for conference travel, he compiled a series of conference proceedings and invited all of us to view and discuss them. It was inspiring to be a part of these discussions and widen our horizons on how we could do better. 

He started the practice of design critique sessions with the team and these have been invaluable in taking and giving feedback. 

He is everything one could look for in a good mentor.
