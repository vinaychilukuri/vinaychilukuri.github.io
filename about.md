##### ABOUT ME

The great actor, Robert De Niro once said that his favorite word was <b>refinement</b>. While I am no one in comparison, the urge to constantly refine and go beyond one's limitations is what drives me.
 
As a master's graduate in Human Computer Interaction & Cognitive Science, I have 5.5 years of experience in user-centred design, usability testing and building products. I have also hand-coded [web apps](http://www.slashcv.com){:target="_blank"} in the past.

I am a methodical designer who asks the right questions to get a holistic picture of the problem at hand. I have helped teams streamline their workflows by setting up a strong design process. I not only design, but also infuse design thinking in the people around me. 

I have led a team of 5 designers in the past and I loved mentoring and facilitating the team in producing great work.

Outside of work, you will find me talk passionately about yoga, movies and traveling. I took some time-off from my corporate career to volunteer for a non-profit organization for 6 months and have loved the experience.

I am looking to collaborate with a team of talented folks from whom I could learn from and share my passion for what I do. If you are interested to know more -- [please get in touch](mailto:vinay.chilukuri@gmail.com).
