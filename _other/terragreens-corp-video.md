As a filmmaker, my interest was to unearth the stories that needed to be told, to have voices heard, to make people aware of the happenings, to make them aware of their own condition -- being human.

## Background

Terragreens was an organic food production company that not only produced 100% certified organic food but also acted as a benefactor to the farmers who wished to switch to the organic side of food production. 

## My role & the process
My role was to shoot a corporate video for TerraGreens. Instead of focusing on the various aspects of the company, I focused on bringing out the story of the founder & CEO. I wanted to understand her motivations to start this company, her challenges, and her aspirations for the company going forward. 

> I felt that excavating the story of the person, rather than a business entity, was critical in forming an emotional connect with the audience.

I have drafted a list of points that would enable me to delve deeper into the story. I conducted an extensive 3 hour interview with the founder/CEO to understand her motivations about starting the company and her challenges in doing so.

<!-- I have then visited the organic farm to understand their methods of organic food production, to talk to farmers and see how they were getting benefited by switching to organic mode of farming. -->

Conducting this interview not only helped me to understand, but enabled me to gain empathy which informed me through out the filmmaking process. Without a doubt, it helped me craft a compelling story.

## My learnings
Making this video was an enriching experience for me both as a storyteller and also an individual. The video had created the needed impact for the company in it's corporate presentations. In the words of the founder, 
> "This video earned me a lot of respect for what I do, in the community". 

Hearing such feedback from the client encourages one to do even better work.

I have learnt immensely from being a filmmaker -- finding stories, understanding conflict and presenting it on the screen. This later influenced my design process especially in the aspect of User Research. Unearthing stories is a critical skill for both filmmakers and designers. Both deal with the human condition.
