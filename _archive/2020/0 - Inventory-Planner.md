### Background
Inventory Planner is a system that is used by multiple stakeholders to raise purchase orders, to return inventory and to set policies in terms of how the replenishment of goods should happen. This is critical for the effective functioning of an ecommerce business.

<blockquote>
Essentially, what to buy, how much to buy and where to place these goods is decided by the Inventory Planning system.
</blockquote>

### The Problem
The product team approached the design team with the following brief: "Though there is a system in place, not many users are using it fully. We think it is because of the system's usability issues and we want you to fix it." However, later during the course of research, I realised that the system didn't accommodate our users' workflows.

### My Role
I was the lead designer on the project. My manager was a part of the user research sessions, initially. I was also responsible for redesigning the IA, Interaction flows and Visual Design.

## Immersing in User Research
I did not know anything about our users until I started this project. My manager and I promptly requested for a thorough User research study with our key stakeholders. These were 1-on-1 interviews to understand the day in the life of our users and how they were using the existing Inventory Planning system.

Our users speak in such jargon, that it was very tough for me to unpack everything that they were saying. Also, the supply chain process is a complex beast. Sometimes, I used to feel lost in making sense of what was being said. I used to tell my manager that I feel slow in understanding things. He said, "This is the most complex project you will work on, in Flipkart. It will take time. Do not worry."

<!-- ##### Activity
15 one-on-one User Interviews with primary & secondary users.

##### My Allies 🧑🏽‍🚀
- My manager and his support &mdash; His presence in the initial interviews helped me gain confidence as I was new to the system.
- Product Managers helped in reaching out to users of the platform and introduced us to them.

##### Obstacles ⚔️
- I was struggling to understand what our users were saying.
- Too much jargon to process
- Supply-chain is a very complex domain.
- I was doubting myself if I I was slow in understanding!

##### How did I overcome? 💪🏽
- Persistently listening to the audio recordings again & again. Long traffic jams in Bengaluru helped ;)
- Ruthlessly simplified everything that was said into simple language. -->

We have the following users for the Inventory Planner system:

##### Primary users of our platform:
- Inventory Planners responsible for maintaining the in-stock quantity in each of the Flipkart warehouses across India.
- Key Account Managers (KAM) responsible for business development with Vendors.
- Category Operations responsible for enabling KAMs to manage the business.


##### Secondary users:
- Business Finance responsible for certain approvals for large monetary orders.
- Inventory Planning Directors also responsible for certain approvals.

I consciously told myself that, "It is okay to not understand everything that is being said during the interviews. My job as a designer is to listen actively."
The audio recordings of the interviews helped me immensely in sense-making. I used to listen to them during my daily commute to office without the burden of the time-boxed nature of the interview.  Repeatedly hearing to what the users were saying not only helped me to understand what they do, but also empathise with their pain of using the existing system.

I always ended my user interviews with this question, "When you went home and if you had to say, 'Today was great' -- What would have happened?" -- This is a good way to glean emotional information from our users.

### The hardest part of user research
Research analysis & synthesis is the hardest part of doing User research, in my opinion. Transcribing all the interviews manually by myself and logging each of the points in to Trello was a lot of work. It took me almost a month to finish this step. But, by the end of this, **the clarity that I had about my users gave me HUGE confidence in how to approach the design of the system.**

🗣
I also socialised the Trello board with my PMs so that they can comb through the user transcripts and use them for their understanding, in building future ideas for the platform.

### Synthesizing the research data gave rise to the following pain-points.

### Understanding the pain-points of the users helped me frame the following design principles in order for the platform to be trusted and adopted.

## Co-creating with users to make the system more than transactional

<span class='img-caption'>I did a co-creation activity by inviting a few users we had spoken to, during user research.</span>
</div>

### I learnt about a key moment 🔑 in the user journey:
"Every week we have a review meeting with our Directors. We rely on a lot of excel sheets to pull data to present in this meeting, in terms of how each of our portfolios are doing. If the system could present this data for us, it will save us a lot of pain.

I have arrived at the below dashboard design based on the learnings from the co-creation exercise.

</div>

### With regular check-ins with my stakeholders, I have socialised the point-of-view of design and painted the picture of how the system should evolve.

I've created designs for all the screens of Inventory Planner and Returns planner systems. The dashboard view has not been implemented yet, because of the lack of backend data. Backend engineering is working to incorporate all these signals present on the dashboard so that the UI could render it.

### Impact 📈
- **34** point increase in NPS. New score at 86.
- Operational efficiency improved from 2.25 days to **1.37 days**.

### My learnings
- Show your vision of how the product can deliver intended outcomes for the business. (This is how you stay at the table.)
- Socialize User Research findings more rigorously to drive user-centricity in stakeholders.
- Socialize User Research findings more rigorously to drive user-centricity in stakeholders.

### Success of this project
<blockquote>
"Design is not just how it looks.
But, it is about how it works." &mdash; Steve Jobs
</blockquote>
This project epitomises that, IMHO.

The success of this project brought immense value for Design in the Org. Design was thought of making something pretty but here how a system should work has been defined and delivered.
