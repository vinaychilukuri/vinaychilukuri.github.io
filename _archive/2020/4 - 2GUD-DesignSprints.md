<b>What to build</b> is a critical question to be answered for any product team.
I proposed to our product team that we try out a Design Sprint to arrive at a concrete answer.

I facilitated 3 sprints to involve every key player from the product, business and engineering teams in the design process. For me, this was also a way of showing how design empowers product definition and development.

### Background Context

With the strategy of 2GUD pivoting to cater to the next 100 million users in Tier 2,3,4 towns of India, and having data that the existing ecommerce UIs weren't working for a majority of users, innovation was the need of the hour. We had to think out of the box.

My intent was to help our stakeholders embrace user-centered thinking so that the solutions we come up with are not just an imitation of a competitions' features but based on first-principles thinking.

I proposed to the product team that we try out Design sprints to give us structure and help us solve the problems we have with 2GUD.

### Introducing the team to Design Sprints
I have modified the 5-day structure of the sprint. Given that we knew that we would not be getting 5 days of everyone's time, I decided to do the first 2 days of the sprint with all our stakeholders. 

Our group product manager blocked the key stakeholders' calendars and sent reminders about a 'Design Sprint'. He ensured that everyone showed up on time. 

The participants had a lot of questions about what a Design Sprint is. I've introduced the double diamond üî∑üî∑ framework and how it ties to the concept of a design sprint. I explained how the exercises of the sprint would help to get shared understanding and make product design a truly collaborative process.

### 1Ô∏è. Problem Identification
I've facilitated the following exercises of the sprint to unearth the problems that we have as of today.

We picked this question to be answered via the Sprint
## How Might We communicate the various business lines of 2GUD, unambiguously?

### 2. Whet your appetite &mdash; Divergent Thinking
Having done the homework earlier, each our sprints started with a How Might We statement. I then introduced the lightning demo exercise that helped participants to whet their creative juices and move into ideation.

I saw the true value of divergent thinking with multiple people, with diverse backgrounds, involved. I was amazed with the creativity in the room. <i>I confess that I myself would've never come up with such interesting ideas.</i>

### 3Ô∏è. Convergent Thinking & Crazy Eights
I find this to be the most interesting aspect of the exercise. Having each person to create at least 8 variations of a single idea lead to some very creative ideas. Even though participants often struggle with this exercise, the energy of the facilitator is important to let the participants go through this one.

And, this Design Sprint playlist helped, immensely in making participants not get stuck with a few ideas. I also improvised a lot in terms of how the participants were seated, what to say to them to keep the momentum going with my novice facilitation skills.

### 4Ô∏è. Voting & Decision making

We used dot-voting to understand which ideas resonated with people the most. The idea that received the most üî• was - Mimicking the experience of going to an offline shop and the shopkeeper greeting & guiding the way.

### 5Ô∏è. Prototyping & Testing
In two days, I prototyped the most voted concept - Mimicking the experience of being greeted by a shopkeeper in an offline store. Making the shopkeeper help the person guide the way.

Our sprint question was to see if we could communicate the various business lines of 2GUD in an unambiguous manner. PMs from our team tested this concept with real world people who were not aware of 2GUD.

7 people were given this prototype and asked the question, "What would you find in this app?" Everyone answered positively. They were amused that they were being greeted by someone within the app. 

We were relieved that we have a great direction in terms of how to solve our ambiguous communication.

### Next Steps

Using the prototype, I got buy-in from Business & Marketing to redo the visual language of the platform. I am working with a couple of graphic designers for this exercise. This is new & challenging territory to me. We are using some of the ideas from our previous sprints and exploring interesting creative direction for 2GUD.

### How I changed as a designer, through this project?

Design thinking is a powerful tool to come up with innovative solutions to the problem at hand. Even though I was exhausted in the process of planning & facilitating the sprint -- my adrenaline pumped up when I saw the amazing creative ideas from the participants of the sprint. 

I was the sprint facilitator and also the designer. It became incredibly challenging to play both roles and still having to do design work part of other OKRs. This is a big NO. I have understood how intense a sprint is and the need for one to plan meticulously.

I have to thank the product team for being so open and placing trust in me to try a new way of working. Without their trust in me -- this wouldn't have come to fruition. Grateful üôèüèΩ
