Isha Foundation, founded by [Sadhguru](http://isha.sadhguru.org){:target="_blank"}, is a non-profit that concerns human wellbeing and spiritual development through Yoga. 
It's offerings were scattered across 42 websites! As a result, the experience was totally fragmented with a fundamental problem -- the key information was not at all discoverable.

Team ISHA wanted to build a mobile experience to bring the key offerings of ISHA under one umbrella. A larger website consolidation project was part of the plan, at a later stage.

## Background

Sadhguru is a contemporary mystic, yogi and a visionary. He is a spiritual master who has a vast online presence in the form of his talks on YouTube, article posts on Facebook and a blog. He has more than 2 million followers on Facebook, as of today.

Touched by the insight of Sadhguru and deep experience that I had felt through ISHA foundation's yoga programs, I signed up as a volunteer.

### My Role
I was contributing as a volunteer on the side by working nights, for about 5 hours per week.

In order for an effective design, there were three things that needed to be done:
1. Understand the user needs and business goals.
2. Structure the content on a strong foundation of Information Architecture (IA).
3. Give a task-oriented context to the information, so that the content could be easily consumed in a mobile context.

## 1) User & Business Needs

Given that there was new wisdom from Sadhguru almost every day either in the form of an article or a video â€” communicating this to the user was one of the primary concerns.

After a few stakeholder interviews, I have uncovered the following needs:

- Users should be able to easily find Sadhguru's content (which are in the form of text, video, audio, and quotes)
- Users should be able to find ISHA foundation's Yoga programs happening in their area.
- The organization needs to promote it's various outreach activities and be able to attract volunteers, donations for each of these.

#### Analytics

Studying analytics data revealed the pages with maximum traffic. This was also an input point in prioritising the information to meet the user's demand.

## 2) Constructing the Information Architecture

Given that there were so many navigation items on the web, I did not want the user to feel the same on the mobile app. I prioritized the content according to user & business needs, frequency of content being updated and re-evaluated the IA of the website.

<!-- ![img]({{page.img_dir}}/isha-web-nav.png) -->

Re-looking at the navigation of the web with the lens of user & business needs yielded the following grouping: 

![img](/assets/img/cases/isha-app/web-mobile-IA.png)

![img]({{page.img_dir}}/sitemap.png)

As I was volunteering on the side, I had little time to do any formal validation of the IA with actual users. The stakeholders had positively agreed to the IA that was proposed based on the user needs, business goals and the frequency of content updates.

### Translating the I.A into a navigation system on mobile

The stakeholders had proposed to have all the navigation items on the web as part of a hamburger menu on the mobile. However, the bottom-bar navigation was a better bet for the information architecture we had.

*The hamburger menu had become so pervasive that people were treating it as a standard.*

![navigation-options center]({{page.img_dir}}/ham--bottom-bar.png)

In order to resolve this, I have not only pointed out Google's then recently updated material design guidelines, but also educated them why the bottom-bar was efficient and how it increases content engagement.


### Prototype

Do navigate through one of the initial prototypes for the app below. It gives clarity on how the IA has been laid out using bottom and top navigation systems.

## 3) Presenting the content in a Mobile context

In the mobile context, users should be able to quickly find what they want, as there is an inherent task-orientedness to it.

The following screen illustrates how content has been re-organized for a mobile context. Each of the items extends to the functionality of the mobile device, thus allowing the user to use their phone to do more with the information on the screen.

### Proposed Visual Scheme
The visual design for the app had been done by in-house ISHA team.
Based on the brand guidelines of ISHA, I have proposed the following visual scheme for the app which has a native feel to it.

<!-- ![img full-width]({{page.img_dir}}/isha_app_vd.png) -->
*However, the team decided to go with the in-house visual design due to development timelines*

<p style="clear:both"></p>
## Conclusion

Ever since the app was released, it had been receiving unanimously positive reviews touting that it is extremely simple to use. Isha yoga program registrations have increased by <b>37%</b>, thanks to the mobile app. Donations through the app were averaging at INR. <b>200k</b> per month, without any marketing whatsoever. Further improvements to the donation forms were planned in order to make the donation experience even better.

This has been one of the most enriching projects that I had worked on, in terms of impact and contributing my bit to the spiritual community.
