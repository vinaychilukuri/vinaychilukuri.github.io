<div class="overview">
<h1 class="post-title">{{ page.title | escape }}</h1>

Completion rates of corporate trainings remain low, despite multiple reminders from Learning & Development teams. Lack of time to prioritize training over work and dis-engaging content are two primary factors for this behaviour.

At KNOLSKAPE, our intention was to address this issue by building a learning ecosystem that would motivate learners to engage with their training material and move towards completion.

### Background

KNOLSKAPE hired an open-source Learning Management System (LMS) as the foundation upon which the intended system would be developed.

### My Role
I was leading the UX for this project and was working along with a product manager. In addition to gathering requirements, translating the requirements to prototypes, I have designed the end-to-end experience for this app starting from signup flows to course-completion. I also conducted usability tests with internal employees in order to remove any confusion in the user flows.

## How do we engage learners in a corporate setting?

### Using Gamification as the magic solution!?
The product team wanted to create a learning product in the B2B space to solve for engagement. The hypothesis was that by adding gamification elements (points, badges & leaderboards to be specific), we would address lack of engagement and create a differentiated product. I had trouble with this approach because we were using Gamification as a magic recipe without understanding it's principles.

**To solve for engagement from an experience perspective**, I proposed that the app should have a personality that it cares about learners' progress and the interactions should be non-serious & playful.

### Constraints
I would have preferred to do primary research to understand user pains with respect to corporate trainings in detail -- but, I was limited due to several factors. I relied on doing secondary research to put myself in the shoes of the users that I was designing for.

I studied user flows for Coursera, Udacity and edX to understand design patterns in the learning space. Google Primer was an inspiration for how to deliver content in an engaging manner using playful illustrations and smooth animations.

### 1. Non-serious Interactions
How information is presented to the user is an important factor in creating a desired perception of the space.

I've used loading states to communicate that the app has a  personality and that it is not serious or business-like. I wanted it not to become too playful as this app would be for users in the corporate sector.

### 2. Caring about the learner's progress
Providing encouragement on the path of learning is an important boost that we can provide to learners. In this respect, it is important to show relevant messages that acknowledges the learnerâ€™s progress. Coupled with right messaging, I have used emoji ðŸ™Œ to achieve a non-serious tone and showing that the system cares about the progress made.

### 3. Gamification
Gamification is a persuasive mechanism that provides an extra push to the user to stay invested in the task at hand. When implemented in the right context, it can be very effective.

However, the team chose to have the popular aspect of gamification  - points, badges & leaderboards, as a feature.

We have had many discussions about effective gamification implementation and how plastering points, badges & leaderboards will not create long-term engagement. In the spirit of an MVP,  we went ahead with these constructs.

### Design Execution & Usability Testing
I have designed about 80 screens for all the flows of the app -- starting from user signup to training course completion.

By conducting internal usability tests, I have made refinements to the core flow of the app.

### Next Steps
The customer development team saw a lot of requests for a post-training engagement model with learners. In response, the product team offered a solution where short consumable content (bites) could be pushed to a learner over a period of time. This seemed to be a good intersection of the business need, the clientsâ€™ need and how users consume content on a mobile device. We acquired 2 clients who were willing to test this app in their ecosystem once a particular training is complete.

I had moved from the company by the time the app was dev-complete and ready for launch.

### My learnings
My contribution as a designer was not just in terms of execution & collaboration, but in adding a certain personality and point-of-view of how the app should feel. I feel that this was an important product differentiator.

The product features were reactionary at times, without a strong rationale. This effected the team and what we wanted to deliver. I have learned that it is important to have the product direction validated before jumping into execution.
