### Background
Inventory Planner is a system that is used by multiple stakeholders to raise purchase orders, to return inventory and to set policies in terms of how the replenishment of goods should happen. This is critical for the effective functioning of an ecommerce business.

<blockquote>
Essentially, what to buy, how much to buy and where to place these goods is decided by the Inventory Planning system.
</blockquote>

### The Problem
The product team approached the design team with the following brief: "Though there is a system in place, not many users are using it fully. We think it is because of the system's usability issues and we want you to fix it." However, later during the course of research, I realised that the system didn't accommodate our users' workflows.

### My Role
I was the lead designer on the project. My manager was a part of the user research sessions, initially. I was also responsible for redesigning the IA, Interaction flows and Visual Design.

### Who are our Users?
##### Primary Users
- **Inventory Planners** &mdash; responsible for the placement of the procured inventory and maintaining the in-stock quantity in each of the Flipkart warehouses across India.
- **Key Account Managers** &mdash; They decide on what products to procure. Responsible for business development with Vendors. 
- **Category Operations** &mdash; responsible for execution of operations to help Flipkart procure goods from Vendors.

##### Secondary Users
- Business Finance &mdash; responsible for certain approvals for large monetary orders.
- Planning Directors &mdash; review warehouse capacity, in-stock and other approvals.


## Immersing in User Research
##### Activity
15 one-on-one User Interviews with primary & secondary users.

##### My Allies üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ
- My manager - His presence in the initial interviews helped me gain confidence as I was new to the system.
- Product Managers helped in reaching out to users of the platform and introduced us to them.

##### Obstacles ‚öîÔ∏è
- I was struggling to understand what our users were saying.
- Too much jargon to process
- Supply-chain is a very complex domain.
- I was doubting myself if I I was slow in understanding!

##### How did I overcome? üí™üèΩ
- Persistently listening to the audio recordings again & again. Long traffic jams in Bengaluru helped ;)
- Ruthlessly simplified everything that was said into simple language.

## Research synthesis
##### Activity
- Transcribed audio user interviews to text.
- Documented the interview findings in Trello.

##### Duration
- 3-4 weeks

<!-- <h5 class="special-block">User pain-points </h5>
- No trust in the numbers thrown by the system, in many instances.
- No view of the system status.
- Spend a lot of time to understand and resolve error messages thrown by the system.
- Their workflow hasn't really changed due to the product. -->

### Synthesizing the research data gave rise to the following pain-points.

##### Key Observations 
People relied on excel-based workflow because of their old habits.
- ‚ÄúI download the data from the product, open it in Excel and verify.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI start my day by downloading the .xls file and look at the in-stock.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIt becomes too cumbersome to manage our portfolio of products on .xls‚Äù.
- ‚ÄúI like Excel because it is great in slicing & dicing the data‚Äù

# Design

### Understanding the pain-points of the users along with their preferences helped me frame the following design principles in order for the platform to be trusted and adopted.

## Co-creating with users to make the system more than transactional

![img center]({{page.img_dir}}/co-creation.png)
<span class='img-caption'>I did a co-creation activity by inviting a few users we had spoken to, during user research.</span>
</div>

### I learnt about a key moment üîë in the user journey:
"Every week we have a review meeting with our Directors. We rely on a lot of excel sheets to pull data to present in this meeting, in terms of how each of our portfolios are doing. If the system could present this data for us, it will save us a lot of pain.

I have arrived at the below dashboard design based on the learnings from the co-creation exercise.

<span class='img-caption'>The dashboard view for Inventory Planner provides a lot of insight for users and helps them with their weekly review meetings.
</span>
</div>

### With regular check-ins with my stakeholders, I have socialised the point-of-view of design and painted the picture of how the system should evolve.

I've created designs for all the screens of Inventory Planner and Returns planner systems. The dashboard view has not been implemented yet, because of the lack of backend data. Backend engineering is working to incorporate all these signals present on the dashboard so that the UI could render it.

### Impact üìà
- **34** point increase in NPS. New score at 86.
- Operational efficiency improved from 2.25 days to **1.37 days**.

### My learnings
- Show your vision of how the product can deliver intended outcomes for the business. (This is how you stay at the table.)
- Socialize User Research findings more rigorously to drive user-centricity in stakeholders.
- Do not try to understand everything in a user-research interview. Be present and LISTEN.

### Success of this project

>"Design is not just how it looks.
But, it is about how it works." &mdash; Steve Jobs

This project epitomises that, IMHO.

The success of this project brought immense value for Design in the Org. Design was thought of making something pretty but here how a system should work has been defined and delivered.
