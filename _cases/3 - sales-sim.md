"How do I get better at my job?" is a question that arises in almost all of us at some point in a professional career. One of the most common solutions addressing this question in a corporate environment is **training.** However, these trainings often times are boring, tedious and in most cases lack any real life connection.

To improve the effectiveness of these trainings, [KNOLSKAPE](http://www.knolskape.com){:target="_blank"} creates a differentiator by simulating the real world environments of corporate teams and having the users experience it before they get into their role. (Eg: The user of a simulation has to step into the shoes of a manager and lead a team.)

The intent was to build a simulated training intervention for Sales executives with an experience of 0-3 years.

## Background

During a product strategy session, our CEO had announced that we should be working on a new product -- a simulation for sales executives. He opined that since there were no effective trainings that teach a formal sales process to freshers, a simulation about the process of selling, would work well in this regard. Some of the people in the room looked determined while some of us looked confused without much context and data supporting this claim.

### Bringing order to the chaos

To bring clarity to the disucssion, I requested our CEO to go through the problem and the proposed solution in the format of a Business Model Canvas (BMC). I used the Lean Canvas framework to capture inputs from various stakeholders.

![lean-canvas](https://notion.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.notion-static.com%2F616a5a261b6f43c3937d95fb80691ee8%2Fleancanvas.png?w=1.0&s=1a8a41ce66e919bf69a5bc8d93317051)

This process helped all of us to get a shared understanding of the problem. Regarding the solution, a simulated assessment for sales training, I have felt that the team had jumped to a solution that it was comfortable in building in the past than searching for one that effectively addresses the customer needs.

> Is the proposed solution good enough to make a positive impact on a sales person's performance? Can we do something better?

I voiced out my concern. The reply was it definitely was not enough, but this was a step in the right direction.
I was not fully convinced.

## User Research
I sought agreement about talking to the users before jumping in to the solution mode, as I did not have any context of the world of Sales. My CEO proactively connected me with few of his contacts from the Sales community.

*I jotted down the following questions that would act as a guide in the interviews*

### User Interviews

I started my one-on-one interviews with our 5 internal sales folks. Hearing their stories on the field, made me respect what they did. I then interviewed 5 Sales managers/directors to know their point of views on sales training. Lastly, I have conducted an open-ended survey with one of the largest LinkedIn communities in Sales ([Sales Best Practices)](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/35771){:target="_blank"}

The thing that surprised me the most was none of the 10 people that I had interviewed remembered attending any training to learn the ropes of the sales process. Their learning was all on the job.

## Synthesis

I have synthesized the findings from the user interviews and the survey in the style of an empathy map.

![empathy-map center]({{page.img_dir}}/sales-emp-map.png)

It was clear that though imparting a sales process was important, there were other pressing pain points that are hindering sales people to get better at their jobs. In my opinion, targeting a pain point that people are aware of leads to better adoption of a solution.

## Proposing a solution — How might we?

From my observations, a sales person needed the most support in the context of a meeting. Meetings are critical in making progress - be it qualifying a lead, negotiating with them, or closing the deal. The better the meeting, the better the possibility of a deal.

> I refined the problem of  "How do I get better at my job?" to "How might we enable him/her perform better every time in a sales meeting?"

This refined the problem into a more specific space-time and enabled me to brainstorm various solutions.

From a business stand-point, using a service every time a sales person has a meeting, which is frequent, is of higher value than conducting a training intervention once or twice a year.

Armed with the empathy of talking to sales folks and understanding their pain points, I  proposed a solution that addresses the above scenario. (*I cannot divulge any aspect of the solution due to the N.D.A that I have with KNOLSKAPE.*)

### Technical Challenges

The solution was received with great enthusiasm and everyone saw the value in it, including our internal sales team. However, in order to build a solution of this manner required deep technological expertise on mobile, which was then not the case. The harsh reality was the team was not equipped enough in terms of skill to build the proposed solution. We did not have the option of outsourcing this as it would mean a lot of development time. As a result, the product team could not immediately jump in building this.

> I had to digest that the solution proposed by me, though had great potential, due to the business and technological constraints — was not green lit.

However, the learnings from the study did not go waste. We wanted to combine the pain points unearthed from the study and use it in the initial idea of simulated assessment.

## Testing the solution without a product

In order to see if the simulated assessment which was now refined due to the learnings from my user research studies, had any potential - I proposed to design a report that would be generated once a user takes the simulated assessment.

We wanted to test if this generated report and the metrics we were showing to Sales Managers had enough value for them to hire KNOLSKAPE as their training provider for Sales.

What went into the report were totally driven by my understanding of the pain points from the user research study that I have done. This style of testing, apparently, is called a Wizard of Oz test in the lean startup world, for reasons unknown to me.

We spoke to the potential customers and they showed enough interest in having a report like this for each of their employees. The important learning is that this solution benefits the customer and not as much to the end user. In a B2B environment, this is crucial because the solution should appeal to choosers first and then the users. 

## Key Learnings & Impact

User research helps in developing a deep bond with the users and truly enables one to be user-centric instead of guessing what the user might want.

In my opinion, conducting diary studies would have revealed the pain points for a sales person, in greater depth. However, I was not aware of this technique at the time of starting this study.

### Impact

This study has strengthened the case for user research in the organization not just for the benefit of design teams but it also allowed Product Managers to know the business problems in more detail and take an informed decisions in formulating the product requirements. It allowed Sales folks to hone their narratives and be more client-centric when they pitch a solution to their clients. Also, the insights user research even helped the learning solutions team of KNOLSKAPE to create an effective training material for a Sales journey.

By end of it all I imbibed that the adoption of user research as a practice is a critical step in improving the design maturity of an organization and raising the value a designer brings to the table.
