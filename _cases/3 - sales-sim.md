<h1 class="post-title">{{ page.title | escape }}</h1>

"How do I get better at my job?" is a question that arises in almost all of us at some point in a professional career. One of the most common solutions addressing this in a corporate environment is **training.** However, these trainings often times are boring, tedious and lack any real life connection.

To improve the effectiveness of these trainings, [KNOLSKAPE](http://www.knolskape.com){:target="_blank"} creates a differentiator by simulating the real world environments of corporate teams and having the users experience it before they get into their role. (Eg: The user of a simulation has to step into the shoes of a manager and lead a team.)

In this vein, a project to build a simulated training intervention for Sales executives with an experience of 0-3 years, was proposed.

### Background

During a strategy session, our CEO had announced that we develop a new product -- a training simulation for sales executives. He opined that since there were no effective trainings that teach a formal sales process to freshers, a simulation about the process of selling, would work well in this regard. Most of the people in the room looked confused without much context of the problem.

### Understanding the problem

To bring clarity to the disucssion, I requested our CEO to go through the problem and the proposed solution in the format of a Business Model Canvas (BMC). I used the Lean Canvas framework to capture inputs from various stakeholders.

![lean-canvas](https://notion.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.notion-static.com%2F616a5a261b6f43c3937d95fb80691ee8%2Fleancanvas.png?w=1.0&s=1a8a41ce66e919bf69a5bc8d93317051)

This process helped everyone get a shared understanding of the problem. Regarding the solution, however, I felt that the team had jumped to a solution that it was comfortable in building in the past than searching for one that effectively addresses the customer needs.

> Is the proposed solution good enough to make a positive impact on a sales person's performance? Can we do something better?

I voiced out my concern. It definitely was not enough, but this was a step in the right direction -- was the reply. I did not find the proposed solution convincing as a means to solve the pain.

## User Research

I sought agreement about talking to the users before jumping in to the solution mode, as I did not have any context of the world of Sales. I also wanted to know the impact of a lack of a formal training in Sales. My CEO proactively connected me with few of his contacts from the Sales community.

<!-- *I jotted down the following questions that would act as a guide in the interviews*

### User Interviews

I started my one-on-one interviews with our 5 internal sales folks. I then interviewed 5 Sales managers to know their point of views on sales performance. Lastly, I have conducted an open-ended survey with a LinkedIn community in Sales ([Sales Best Practices)](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/35771){:target="_blank"}

<div id="sales-user-research"></div>
<ul class="gallery">
	<li data-thumb="{{page.img_dir}}/thumb-1.svg"><img src="{{page.img_dir}}/user-int-afmap.png" alt="user interviews"></li>
	<li data-thumb="{{page.img_dir}}/thumb-2.svg"><img src="{{page.img_dir}}/manager-int-afmap.png" alt="manager interviews"></li>
	<li data-thumb="{{page.img_dir}}/thumb-3.svg"><img src="{{page.img_dir}}/survey-summary.png" alt="survey-summary"></li>
</ul>

It was surprising to find out that none of the 10 interviewees had attended any formal training to learn Sales. Their learning was all on the job.

### Synthesis

*Findings from user research synthesized in the style of an empathy map.*

![empathy-map center]({{page.img_dir}}/sales-emp-map.png)

I've learnt that though teaching a formal process was important for someone at the start of their career, there were other pressing pain points. Moreover, this was not something people were conscious of. Targeting a pain point that people are aware of leads to better adoption of a solution.

## Proposing a solution â€” How might we?
From my observations, a sales person needed the most support in the context of a **client meeting.** Meetings are critical in making progress - be it qualifying a lead, negotiating with them, or closing a deal. The better the meeting, the better the prospect of a deal.

> I refined the problem of  "How do I get better at my job?" to "How might we enable him/her perform better every time in a sales meeting?"

This refinement into a more specific space-time helped me in exploring various ideas.

	<li><img src="{{page.img_dir}}/sales-sketch2.jpg"></li>
	<li><img src="{{page.img_dir}}/sales-sketch3.jpg"></li>
</ul>

*(I cannot divulge finer aspects of the solution due to the N.D.A that I have with KNOLSKAPE.)*

The solution was received with great enthusiasm and everyone saw the value in it, including our internal sales team.

### Technical Challenges

The solution required deep mobile development expertise which was lacking at that point. We had agreed to build a web version and make it work on a tablet. It was a compromise because the solution hinged on supporting the sales executive **on-the-go** before a meeting.

### Validating the solution
To test if this solution had enough value, I proposed to design a report that would be generated once a user uses our product for a period of time.

Our product manager spoke to potential customers (Sales Managers) about the value of a summative performance report for their team members. We received inputs on the metrics they expected to see in the report.

Armed with this knowledge, we proceeded for development of the solution.

## Key Learnings & Impact

User research helps in developing a deep bond with the users and truly enables one to be user-centric instead of guessing what the user might want.

In retrospect, conducting diary studies would have revealed the pain points for a sales person, in greater depth. However, I was not aware of this technique at the time of starting this study.

### Impact

*The product was in development by the time I had moved from the organization.*

This study strengthened the case for user research. It allowed Product Management to take informed decisions in formulating the product requirements. It allowed Sales folks to hone their narratives and be more client-centric when they pitch a solution to their clients. Also, the insights from research helped the Learning solutions team to create an effective training material for a Sales journey.

The adoption of user research as a practice is a critical step in improving the design maturity of an organization.
