This is a case-study about my attempt in conducting primary research to understand the problem-space and there by have the ability to truly empathize with users. The results from user research coupled with validating solutions before-hand facilitated the team in formulating an informed product strategy that had users' pain-points at the core.

DURATION: Year of 2016.

## Background

"How do I get better at my job?" is a common drive that people have. The underlying motivations for this is to have better economic situations, better productivity, moving up the career ladder or perhaps to have a fulfilling life.

One of the most common solutions addressing "How do I get better at my job?" in a corporate environment is training. These trainings often times are boring, tedious and in most cases lacks any real life connection or resemblance.

To improve the retention, motivation, effectiveness of these trainings, KNOLSKAPE creates a differentiator by simulating the real world environments of corporate teams and having the users experience it before they get into their role (Eg: The user of a simulation has to step into the shoes of a manager and lead a team.)

## Problem

During a product brainstorming session, the project management team and our CEO agreed that the new product would be a simulation around Sales training, as they all thought there was a lack of an effective training intervention in the sales space. Most of them looked determined while some of us squirmed in our seats without much data supporting this claim.

### Bringing order to the chaos

In order for all the stakeholders to be on the same page and bring in clarity, I requested the senior management including my CEO to go through the problem and the proposed solution in the format of a Business Model Canvas (BMC). I used the Lean Canvas framework to capture inputs from various stakeholders. This process helped all of us immensely to get to a shared understanding of the problem.

![lean-canvas](https://notion.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.notion-static.com%2F616a5a261b6f43c3937d95fb80691ee8%2Fleancanvas.png?w=1.0&s=1a8a41ce66e919bf69a5bc8d93317051)

During this exercise, the CEO clarified who the product is catered for:

- 18-35 years old, need not be tech savvy, not very analytical. 
- They can be students, new sales guys or experienced sales guys of 0-3 year experience, who are dealing with sales operations. 
- This is not going to be a simulation for Sales leaders or managers of sales executives. 

##### My thought was:

> Is a sales simulation enough to make a positive impact on the sales person's performance? Can we do something better? 

I voiced out my concern. The reply was it definitely was not enough, but this was a step in the right direction.
I was not convinced.

### Understanding the Users' world

I sought agreement about talking to the users before jumping in to the solution mode. Reason being - I was clueless about the field of Sales. I clearly communicated my inability to design without any knowledge of the field or what the problems were. My CEO agreed to my approach. He proactively connected me with few of his contacts from the Sales community.

I jotted down the following questions and talking points that would guide me in uncovering the pain points of our potential users:

## User Interviews with Sales executives

As they say, charity begins at home, I started my one-on-one interviews with our 5 internal sales folks and wanted to know how they got into sales, how did they learn, what are the challenges inherent on the field etc. 

<!-- After a brief introduction to why I am doing this interview, I always started with the question: "How did you get into Sales?" My intent was to see if they had a formal training, or if they had undergone corporate trainings to learn the ropes. It was always by accident. 
 -->

![img](/assets/img/cases/sales/user-int-af-map.png)

Hearing their stories on the field, made me respect what they did.
> As the last question in my interviews, I asked, "What is a good day to you?" — "the day that I had cracked a deal", was the unanimous response, from each one of them.

## User Interviews with Sales Managers

Though our users are going to be Sales personnel on the field, our customers are Sales Managers and Directors. I interviewed them to understand what their perception of the field is about. How do they help their folks learn?

![img sd](/assets/img/cases/sales/manager-int-af-map.png)

The thing that surprised me the most was none of the 5 people I had interviewed remembered attending any training to learn the ropes of the sales process. Their learning was also on the job.

<!-- 
- I discovered that there were enough gatherings of company wide sales folks that discussed about the big picture stuff like strategies, changes in their industry due to technology, how to adopt to these changes etc. 
- When asked if a training would have helped them start off — I got a strong NO from 3 people and 2 people had said it might help only a little. (In other words, it was not a must-have).
- When asked about how new folks are on boarded into the sales process, I discovered that large organizations had a learning management system which talked about the sales culture of the organization.
- I wanted to know if there are no trainings in the field of Sales. I learnt that sales trainings are often expensive engagements and they would be given to people who are already performing well. This was surprising to hear. 
- Digging a little deeper, I  discovered that these trainings usually focus on a unique method of selling and are most effective in terms of ROI, if performing sales folks attend these. This knowledge could anyway be passed down to the rest of the team, later. -->

## Open-ended survey with a LinkedIn Sales group

I had the apprehension that I spoke to only a few people (5 each) and perhaps my observations are not enough to form a pattern of behavior.So, I approached one of the largest LinkedIn communities in Sales ([Sales Best Practices)](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/35771){:target="_blank"} and the solicited response to an open-ended survey (of 10 questions)

I received 20 responses from Sales Executives and 14 responses from people who were Sales Managers. Though the number of respondents was few, their responses shed light on the pain points they had faced in their respective fields. <!-- Most interestingly, close to 40% of the respondents mentioned that they have undergone sales training which taught them how to qualify, prospect and negotiate along with a few other behavioral skills! The first time I had heard this, in the course of my study. However, not even one person had mentioned that a lack of formal training of the sales process is a pain point. -->

## Summary of the User Research

I have synthesized the findings from the user interviews and they survey in the style of an empathy map.

![empathy-map center](/assets/img/cases/sales/sales-emp-map.png)

It was clear that though imparting a sales process was important, there were other pressing pain points that are hindering sales people to get better at their jobs. In my opinion, targeting a pain point that people are aware of leads to better adoption of a solution.

## Proposing a solution — How might we?

Looking at the pain points from the above research, it was evident that supporting a sales personnel in the context of a sales meeting (either on the field or over a call) is more important than creating a training intervention once a year or 6 months. This is because the meetings are the main crucial indicators for a sales person to make progress in qualifying a lead, negotiating with them and then closing the deal. 

> In summary, I refined the problem of  "How do I get better at my job?" to "How can I perform better every time I attend a sales meeting?"

From a business stand-point, using a service every time a sales person has a meeting is of higher value than conducting a training intervention once a year.

Armed with the empathy of talking to sales folks and understanding their pain points, I  proposed a solution that addresses the above scenario. I, of course, cannot divulge any aspect of the solution due to the N.D.A that I have with KNOLSKAPE.

### Technical Challenges

The solution was received with great enthusiasm and everyone saw the value in it, including our internal sales team. However, in order to build a solution of this manner required deep technological expertise on mobile, which was then not the case. The harsh reality was the team was not equipped enough in terms of skill to build the proposed solution. We did not have the option of outsourcing this as it would mean a lot of development time. As a result, the product team could not immediately jump in building this.

> I had to digest that the solution proposed by me, though had great potential, due to the business and technological constraints — was not green lit.

However, the learnings from the study did not go waste. We wanted to combine the pain points unearthed from the study and use it in the initial idea of simulated assessment.

## Testing the solution without a product

In order to see if the simulated assessment which was now refined due to the learnings from my user research studies, had any potential - I proposed to design a report that would be generated once a user takes the simulated assessment.

We wanted to test if this generated report and the metrics we were showing to Sales Managers had enough value for them to hire KNOLSKAPE as their training provider for Sales.

What went into the report were totally driven by my understanding of the pain points from the user research study that I have done. This style of testing, apparently, is called a Wizard of Oz test in the lean startup world, for reasons unknown to me.

We spoke to the potential customers and they showed enough interest in having a report like this for each of their employees. The important learning is that this solution benefits the customer and not as much to the end user. In a B2B environment, this is crucial because the solution should appeal to choosers first and then the users. 

## Key Learnings & Impact

User research helps in developing a deep bond with the users and truly enables one to be user-centric instead of guessing what the user might want.

In my opinion, conducting diary studies would have revealed the pain points for a sales person, in greater depth. However, I was not aware of this technique at the time of starting this study.

### Impact

This study has strengthened the case for user research in the organization not just for the benefit of design teams but it also allowed Product Managers to know the business problems in more detail and take an informed decisions in formulating the product requirements. It allowed Sales folks to hone their narratives and be more client-centric when they pitch a solution to their clients. Also, the insights user research even helped the learning solutions team of KNOLSKAPE to create an effective training material for a Sales journey.

By end of it all I imbibed that the adoption of user research as a practice is a critical step in improving the design maturity of an organization and raising the value a designer brings to the table.
